                                        HELLO WELCOME TO MY JAVA CLASS (J2SE)
                            ==============================================================
What is Java ?
=> Java is a multiplatform, object-oriented programming language that runs on billions of devices worldwide.
=> It powers applications, smartphone operating systems, enterprise software, and many well-known programs.
=> Despite having been invented over 20 years ago, Java is currently the most popular programming language 
   for app developers.


Multiplatform:
===================
=> Java was branded with the slogan "write once, run anywhere" (or WORA), and that still holds true today.
=> Java programming code written for one platform, like the Windows operating system, can be easily transferred
   to another platform, like a mobile phone OS, and vice versa without being completely rewritten.
=> Java works on multiple platforms because when a Java program gets compiled, the compiler creates 
   a .class bytecode file that can run on any operating system that has the Java virtual machine (JVM)
    installed on it. 
=> It's typically easy to install JVM on most major operating systems, including iOS, which was not always the case.

Object-oriented:
==================
=> Java was among the first object-oriented programming languages.
=> An object-oriented programming language organizes its code around classes and objects, rather than functions
   and commands. Most modern programming languages, including C++, C#, Python, and Ruby are object-oriented.

Q). What is the Java programming language used for?
-------------------------------------------------------
=> Java is an extremely transferable programming language used across platforms and different types of devices,
  from smartphones to smart TVs.
=> It's used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gaming,
   big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications among other types. Here are some specific, real-world 
   examples of applications that are programmed with Java.

Q ) How to Write Java Application ?
--------------------------------
=> Java code is first written in a Java Development Kit, which are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
=> Programmers write in the Java programming language, which the kit translates into computer code that can be
   read by any device with the right software. This is achieved with a piece of software called a compiler.
=> A compiler takes high-level computer code like Java and translates it into a language that operating systems 
   understand called bytecode.

=> Bytecode is then processed by an interpreter called a Java virtual machine (JVM).
=> JVMs are available for most software and hardware platforms, and this is what allows Java code to be transferred
   from one device to another. To run Java, JVMs load the code, verify it, and provide a runtime environment.

Note :-
========
=> Java Compiler is respnsible for Compiling the Java Application. i.e "javac filename.java"
=> Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is a software is respnsible for executing or run the application.
    i.e "java class-name".

=> After compilation of java file , .class file or Bytecode will be generated inside the folder .
=> JVM executes the .class file/ byte code to get the out put.


Key Points :-
==============
>> In a Java Application N number of classes are allowed.
>> Execution Starts from main() method.
>> If there is no main() method then no compile time error arises , but runtime error arises at the time of Execution
    i.e "Error : main() method not found"
