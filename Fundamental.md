# HELLO WELCOME TO MY JAVA CLASS (J2SE)
-------------------------------------------------

## What is Java?

- Java is a multiplatform, object-oriented programming language that runs on billions of devices worldwide.
- It powers applications, smartphone operating systems, enterprise software, and many well-known programs.
- Despite having been invented over 20 years ago, Java is currently the most popular programming language for app developers.

## Multiplatform:
---------------------------------
- Java was branded with the slogan **"write once, run anywhere"** (WORA), and that still holds true today.
- Java programming code written for one platform, like the Windows operating system, can be easily transferred to another platform, like a mobile phone OS, without being completely rewritten.
- When a Java program gets compiled, the compiler creates a `.class` bytecode file that can run on any operating system with the Java virtual machine (JVM) installed.
- It's easy to install JVM on most major operating systems, including iOS.

## Object-oriented:
---------------------------------
- Java was among the first object-oriented programming languages.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) organizes its code around **classes** and **objects**, rather than functions and commands. Most modern programming languages, including C++, C#, Python, and Ruby, are object-oriented.

## What is the Java programming language used for?
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Java is a highly transferable programming language used across platforms and devices, from smartphones to smart TVs.
- It is used for creating mobile and web apps, enterprise software, IoT devices, gaming, big data, distributed, and cloud-based applications.
- Some specific real-world examples of applications programmed in Java include:
  - Mobile apps
  - Web applications
  - Enterprise systems
  - IoT devices

## How to Write Java Applications?
------------------------------------------------
- Java code is first written in a **Java Development Kit (JDK)**, available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Programmers write in Java, and the JDK translates it into computer code readable by devices using a compiler.
- A **compiler** translates high-level code (like Java) into a language that operating systems understand, called **bytecode**.
- **Bytecode** is processed by the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.
- JVMs are available for most software and hardware platforms, allowing Java code to be transferred across devices. 
- JVMs load the code, verify it, and provide a runtime environment.

## Note:
-----------
- The Java **Compiler** is responsible for compiling the Java application using `javac filename.java`.
- The **JVM** is responsible for executing the application with the command `java class-name`.
- After compilation, a `.class` file (or bytecode) is generated, and the JVM executes it to get the output.

## Key Points:
-----------------------
- A Java application can contain multiple classes.
- Execution starts from the `main()` method.
- If there is no `main()` method, no compile-time error will occur, but a runtime error will arise during execution: `"Error: main() method not found"`.
